Xav's NC Knews.

This is an API I built to (eventually) use during the Front End block of the course. It's built on a PSQL database, the user interacts with endpoints which connect to controllers built with knex.

A good place to start is by checking the main page of the API (https://xavs-nc-knews.herokuapp.com/api/), it serves a map of endpoints and methods for each endpoint.
